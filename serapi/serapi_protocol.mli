(** The SerAPI Protocol *)

(** SerAPI is a set of utilities designed to help users and tool
    creators to interact with {{:https://coq.inria.fr}Coq} in a
    systematic way; in particular, SerAPI was designed to provide full
    serialization and de-serialization of key Coq structures, including
    user-level AST and kernel terms.

    SerAPI also provides a reification of Coq's document building API,
    making it pretty easy to build and check systematically Coq
    documents.

    As of today SerAPI does provide the following components:

    - [serlib]: A library providing serializers for core Coq structures;
      the main serialization format is S-expressions, as [serlib] is
    based on the excellent {{:https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_sexp_conv}ppx_sexp_conv}
    from Jane Street. Support for JSON is currently under development.
    - [sertop]: A toplevel executable exposing a simple document building
    and querying protocol. This is the main component, we document it properly below.
    - [sercomp]: A simple compiler utility for .v files that can input and output
    Coq files in a variety of formats. See its manual for more help.
    - [serload]: TODO

{2 History:}

SerAPI was a {{:https://github.com/ejgallego/jscoq}JsCoq} offspring
project; JsCoq added experimental serialization of Coq terms, however we quickly
realized that this facility would be helpful in the general setting; we also took
advantage of the serialization facilities to specify the Coq building API as a DSL;
the client for the tool was an {{:https://github.com/cpitclaudel/elcoq}experimental Emacs mode}
by ClÃ©ment Pit-Claudel.

The next step was to provide reliable "round-trip" (de)serialization of full Coq documents;
Karl Palmskog contributed the round trip testing infrastructure to make this happen.

{2 Users:}

SerAPI is a bit of a swiss army knife, in the sense that it is a general "talk to Coq" tool and can do
many things; a good way to understand the tool is look at some of its users, see the list of them in the 
{{:https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-serapi/}Project's README}

*)

(** {2 Basic Overview of the Protocol: }

SerAPI protocol can be divided in two main sets of operations:
document creation and checking, and document querying.

Note that the protocol is fully specified as a DSL written in OCaml; thus, its
canonical specification can be found below as documents to the OCaml code.
In this section, we attempt a brief introduction, but the advanced user will
without doubt want to look at the details just below.

{3 Document creation and checking: }

Before you can use SerAPI to extract any information about a Coq document,
you must indeed have Coq parse and process the document. Coq's parsing process
is quite complicated due to user-extensibility, but SerAPI tries to smooth the
experience as much as possible.

A Coq document is basically a list of sentences which are uniquely identified
by a [Stateid.t] object; for our purposes this identifier is an integer.

{b Note:} {e In future versions, sentence id will be deprecated, and instead we will use
Language Server Protocol-style locations inside the document to identify sentences.}

Each sentence has a "parent", that is to say, a previous sentence; the initial sentence has as a parent [sid = 1] ([sid] = sentence id).

Note that the parent is important for parsing as it may modify the parsing itself,
for example it may be a [Notation] command.

Thus, to build or append to a Coq document, you should select a parent sentence and
ask SerAPI to add some new ones. This is achieved with the [(Add (opts) "text")] command.

See below for a detailed overview of [Add], but the basic idea is that Coq will
parse and add to the current document as many sentences as you have sent to it.
Unfortunately, sentence number for the newly added ones is not always predictable but
there are workarounds for that.

If succesfull, [Add] will send back an [Added] message with the location and
new sentence identifier. This is useful to let SerAPI do the splitting of sentences
for you. A typical use thus is:

[(Add () "Lemma addnC n : n + 0 = n. Proof. now induction n. Qed.")]

This will return 4 answers.

{4 Sentence Checking}

Adding a set of sentences basically amounts to parsing, however in most cases Coq
won't try to typecheck or run the tactics at hand. For that purpose you can use the
[(Exec sid)] command. Taking a sentence id, [Check] will actually check [sid] and
all the sentences [sid] depends upon.

Note that in some modes Coq can skip proofs here, so in order to get a fully-checked
document you may have to issue [Check] for every sentence on it. Checking a
sentence twice is usually a noop.

{4 Modification of the Document}

In order to modify a "live" document, SerAPI does provide a [(Cancel sid)] command.
[Cancel] will take a sentence id and return the list of sentences that are
not valid anymore.

Thus, you can edit a document by cancelling and re-adding sentences.

{5 Caveats}

Cancelling a non-executed part is poorly supported by the underlying Coq checking algorithm.
In particular, [Cancel] will force execution up to the previous sentence; thus it is not possible
to parse a list of sentences and then replace them without incurring in the cost of executing them.
In particular, it could be even the case that after issuing [Cancel sid], there is an error in the
execution of an unrelated sentence. It should be possible to identify this sentence using the
exception attributes. As of today, this remains a hard-limitation of the STM.

{3 Querying documents: }

For a particular point on the document, you can query Coq for information about
it. Common query use cases are for example lists of tactics, AST, completion, etc...
Querying is done using the [(Query (opts) query)] command. The full specification
can be found below.

A particulary of [Query] is that the caller must set all the pertinent output options.
For example, if the query should return for-humans data or machine-readable one.

{2 Non-interactive use }

In many cases, non-interactive use is very convenient; for that, we
recommend you read the help of the `sercomp` compiler.

(** {3 Basic Protocol Objects}

SerAPI can return different kinds of objects as an answer to queries; object type is
usually distinguished by a tag, for example [(CoqString "foo")] or [(CoqConstr (App ...)]

Serialization representation is derived from the OCaml representation automatically, thus
the best is to use Merlin or some OCaml-browsing tool as to know the internal of each type;
we provide a brief description of each object:
