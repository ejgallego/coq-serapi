## Version 0.17.1:

 - [sertop] Don't initialize `CoqworkmgrApi` (@ejgallego, #340)
 - [serapi] New query `SecVars` that will print section variables used
            by a constant (#342, fixes #339, reported by @HazardousPeach)

## Version 0.17.0:

 - [serlib] (!) Serialization format of generic arguments has changed
            to be conforming to usual `ppx_sexp_conv` conventions.
            (@ejgallego , fixes #273)
 - [serapi] (!) support for Coq 8.17, upstream structures seem pretty
            stable from 8.16, except for `Constr.Evar` (@ejgallego)
 - [serapi] SerAPI is now in Coq's CI (@ejgallego @alizter)

## Version 0.16.3:

 - [serlib] Fix JSON serialization for generic arguments (@ejgallego, #321)

## Version 0.16.2:

 - [sertop] Add `--impredicative-set` command line option (@dhilst , #288)
 - [serlib] Added support for some more plugins from coq-core (ltac2,
            cc, micromega, number_string_notation) (@ejgallego, #284, #306)

## Version 0.16.1:

 - [sertop] Allow to set `--coqlib` using the `COQLIB` environment
            variable. The cmdline argument option still has
            precedence.
 - [serapi] Allow to parse expressions too with
            `(Parse (entry Constr) $text)` (@ejgallego, fixes #272)

## Version 0.16.0:

 - [serapi] (!) support for Coq 8.16, see upstream changes and SerAPI
            test-suite changes for more information. Remarkable
            changes are:
            - kernel terms are serialized a bit differently now due to
              KerName being used in more places upstream. Some
              internal structures also changes in kernel's env, so be
              attentive if you are depending on them.
            - plugin loading is adapted for 8.16 findlib loading
              method
            (@ejgallego)
 - [deps]   Require cmdliner >= 1.1.0 (@ejgallego)
 - [deps]   Support Jane Street libraries v0.15.0 (@ejgallego)
 - [serapi] New query `Objects` to dump Coq's libobject (@ejgallego)

 - [serlib] Large refactoring on Serlib, using functors, see serlib/README.md
            (@ejgallego)
 - [serapi] (!) Query `Proofs` has changed type and will now return the
            partial terms under construction (#271 , fixes #270, @ejgallego)

## Version 0.15.1:

 - [serlib] Fix bad bypass of opaquetab serialization. This caused a
            segfault in some cases.

## Version 0.15.0:

 - [serapi] (!) support for Coq 8.15, see upstream changes; nothing
            too remarkable so far, except for `NewTip` -> `NewAddTip`
            in the answer response, we may want to add a compat layer
            for this if problematic. (#265, @ejgallego)

## Version 0.14.0:

 - [serapi] (!) support for Coq 8.14, see upstream changes; nothing
            too remarkable other than `NewDoc` will now ignore
            loadpaths due to new init setup upstream.
            (#253, @ejgallego)
 - [ci]     SerAPI branches should be able to build now against Coq rc
            packages as to better integrate with Coq's platform beta
            release; thanks to Érik Martin-Dorel, Karl Palmskog and Théo
            Zimmermann for feedback.

## Version 0.13.1:

 - [serapi] New query `(Query () (LogicalPath file))` which will
            return the logical path for a particular `.v` file
            (@ejgallego, see also
            https://github.com/cpitclaudel/alectryon/pull/25)
 - [serapi] new `(SaveDoc opts)` command supporting saving of .vo
            files even when from interactive mode; note that using
            `--topfile` is required (fixes #238, @ejgallego, reported
            by Jason Gross)
 - [sertop] we don't link the OCaml `num` library anymore, this could
            have some impact on plugins (@ejgallego)
 - [nix]    Added Nix support (#249, fixes #248, @Zimmi48, reported
            by @nyraghu)

            particular there are changes in the kernel representation
            of terms [pattern matching, new caseinvert, primitive arrays]

## Version 0.12.1:

 * [serapi]  (!) Bump public library versioning [breaking change]
 * [opam]    Bump upper bound on ppx_sexp_conv to 0.15, allowing SerAPI

 * [serapi]  Fix goal printing anomaly (#230, fixes #228 @corwin-of-amber)
 * [sertop ] New `(Fork (fifo_in file) (fifo_out file))` command, that
             will (hard) fork a new SerAPI process and redirect the
             input / output towards the given Unix FIFOs. This API is
             experimental but should allow quite a few advantages to
             some users willing to perform speculative execution.
             (#210 , improves #202 , @ejgallego)
 - [serapi]  Fix missing newline to separate goals (#235, fixes #231, @ejgallego)

             (#199, @pestun)
 * [sertop]  Set default value of allow-sprop to be true in agreement with upstream coq v8.11

## Version 0.5.7:

 * [serlib] Fixed serializers for more tactics data, add support for
   `ground` plugin (#68). Thanks again to @palmskog for the report.

## Version 0.5.6:

 * [serlib] Fixed serializers for some tactics data (#66) Thanks to
   @palmskog for the report.

## Version 0.5.5:

 * [serlib] Be more lenient when parsing back `Id.t` as to accommodate
   hacks in the Coq AST (#64) Thanks to @palmskog for the report.

## Version 0.5.4:

 * [serlib] Fix critical bug in handling of abstract type (#60)

## Version 0.5.3:

 * [sertop] Support for `-I` option (`--ml-include-path`).

## Version 0.5.2:

 * [serlib] Compatibility with OCaml 4.07.0 [problems with `Stdlib` packing]

## Version 0.5.1:

 * [serlib] (basic) support for serialization of the ssreflect grammar,
 * [serapi] `(Query () (Ast n))` is now `(Query ((sid n)) Ast)`,
 * [serapi] remove broken deprecated `SetOpt` and `LibAdd` commands,
 * [doc] Improved man page.
 * [js] Miscellaneous improvements on the js build.

## Version 0.5.0:

 * [general] support Coq 8.8, use improved document API,
 * [sertop] By default `sertop` will create a new document with `doc_id` 0,
 * [sertop] new debug options, see `sertop --help`.

## Version 0.4:

 * [general] support Coq 8.7 , make use of improved upstream API,
 * [sertop] support `-R` and `-Q` options, note the slightly different
   syntax wrt Coq upstream: `-R dir,path` in place of `-R dir path`,
 * [serlib] support serialization of generic arguments [#41],
 * [serapi] `(ReadFile file)`: hack to load a completed file.

## Version 0.2:

 * Better Query/Object system.

## Version 0.1:

 * Serialization-independent protocol core,
 * [js] Javascript worker,
 * [lib] Better Prelude support,
 * [serlib] Full Serialization of generic arguments,
 * [proto] Add is not a synchronous call anymore,

## Version 0.03:

 * **[done]** Implicit arguments.
 * **[done]** Coq Workers support.
 * **[done]** Advanced Sentence splitting `(Parse (Sentence string))`, which can handle the whole document.

## Version 0.02:

 * **[done]** Serialization of the `Proof.proof` object.
 * **[done]** Improve API: add options.
 * **[done]** Improve and review printing workflow.
 * **[done]** `(Query ((Prefix "add") (Limit 10) (PpStr)) $ObjectType)`
 * **[done]** Basic Sentence splitting `(Parse num string))`, retuns the first num end of the sentences _without_ executing them.
              This has pitfalls as parsing is very stateful.
 * **[done]** Basic completion-oriented Search support `(Query () Names)`
 * **[done]** Better command line parsing (`Cmdliner`, `Core` ?)
 * **[partial]** Print Grammar tactic. `(Query ... (Tactics))`.
   Still we need to decide on:
   `Coq.Init.Notations.instantiate` vs `instantiate`, the issue of
   `Nametab.shortest_qualid_of_global` is a very sensible one for IDEs
